Ansible Docstring Rules
=================================

* Each module must have a short_description section

* short_description must be a string and not a list

    This works:
         short_description: foo, foo, foo

    But this will fail miserably:
         short_description:
           - foo, foo, foo

* Each module must have a description section

* Ansible webdocs do not care about line lengths

* All lines must have some sort of leader

    For example, this works:
         description:
           - foo, foo, foo
           - bar, bar, bar

    However, this will fail:
         description:
           - foo, foo, foo
             bar, bar, bar

(note the lack of - )
